0.3.2 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The possibility to instantiate the CyanLib class without the language utils

    🚧 Fixed :
    - Some typos in the javadocs
    - A translation issue

0.3.3 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - Rules for options, like a minimum and / or maximum value for the integer options

    🚧 Fixed :
    - Translation errors + some typos in javadocs
    - Translation path to get the options descriptions was missing 'getDesc' in CyanLibCommands#getOptionChatConfig()

0.3.5 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The coreConfig commands are now instanciated in this library instead of in each mod
    - The rule `LOAD_CUSTOM_TRANSLATIONS`, which can be held by only 1 option and will tell
      the mod when to load / unload the custom translations (when this option is changed)

0.3.6 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - A screen for the configuration (only works for the client options, but a screen will come to edit the server's options)
    - The screen can be opened via ModMenu or in-game (not in a menu) using the default key `c`

    🚧 Fixed :
    - If an option file was present (for a mod using this library) and contained options that were not in the default options,
      they were kept in the options
    - If an option was in the default options but not in the options file, it was not added to the options
    - When an option with the rule LOAD_CUSTOM_TRANSLATIONS was not exactly named "useCustomTranslations",
      the instances were not created correctly and the custom translations were not loaded correctly

    🫧 Changed :
    - Entirely remade the config system to use a `class` instead of a `Map` (which make it usable with screens)
