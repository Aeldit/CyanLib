0.4.0 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - A screen for the configuration (only works for the client options, but a screen will come to edit the server's options)
    - The screen can be opened via ModMenu or in-game (not in a menu) using the default key `c`

    🚧 Fixed :
    - If an option file was present (for a mod using this library) and contained options that were not in the default options,
      they were kept in the options
    - If an option was in the default options but not in the options file, it was not added to the options
    - When an option with the rule LOAD_CUSTOM_TRANSLATIONS was not exactly named "useCustomTranslations",
      the instances were not created correctly and the custom translations were not loaded correctly

    🫧 Changed :
    - Entirely remade the config system to use a `class` instead of a `Map` (which make it usable with screens)

0.4.1 :
    🚧 Fixed :
    - Crash on server launch (due to missing annotation `@Environment(EnvType.CLIENT)`)
    - Function `hasRule(String optionName, RULES rule)` was only checking for rules in `Integer` options, not `Boolean` ones

    🫧 Changed :
    - `MsgToActionBar` and `MinOpLvlEditConfig` options are now centralized in this library, not each mod using this library

0.4.2 :
    🚧 Fixed :
    - ModMenu Discord link was an old link, no longer functionnal

    🧪 Dev :
    - Simplified the code

    ❌ Remove support for 1.19-1.19.2

0.4.3 :
    🚧 Fixed :

    - A message was sent in the console when using the `/modid config <optionName>` command

0.4.3 :
    Use classes instead of a HashMap to store the options

0.4.5 :
    The functions that were rewritten for each type of option are now a single function.

    This was made using a new interface called `Option<T>`, where `T` is the type of object the options will store

0.4.7 :
    Fix config not being written from the chat

0.4.10+1.21 :
    Fix server unable to launch

0.4.11 :
    - Change the way of registering the default translations
    - Remove the `isPlayer` function
    - Fix missing translation
    - Misc code changes

0.4.12 :
    Make the translations map not static (was causing issues with translations when paired with other mods)

0.4.13 :
    Make the translations of each mod available to every other mod using the CyanLib.

    This fixes many issues where the config commands were not working properly

0.4.14 :
    Remove the screen with the list of all mods using the CyanLib, as there is already ModMenu

0.4.15 :
    Fix error where the user would get the following error message : `The translation key 'cyanlib' doesn't exist`
