0.4.0 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - A screen for the configuration (only works for the client options, but a screen will come to edit the server's options)
    - The screen can be opened via ModMenu or in-game (not in a menu) using the default key `c`

    🚧 Fixed :
    - If an option file was present (for a mod using this library) and contained options that were not in the default options,
      they were kept in the options
    - If an option was in the default options but not in the options file, it was not added to the options
    - When an option with the rule LOAD_CUSTOM_TRANSLATIONS was not exactly named "useCustomTranslations",
      the instances were not created correctly and the custom translations were not loaded correctly

    🫧 Changed :
    - Entirely remade the config system to use a `class` instead of a `Map` (which make it usable with screens)

0.4.1 :
    🚧 Fixed :
    - Crash on server launch (due to missing annotation `@Environment(EnvType.CLIENT)`)
    - Function `hasRule(String optionName, RULES rule)` was only checking for rules in `Integer` options, not `Boolean` ones

    🫧 Changed :
    - `MsgToActionBar` and `MinOpLvlEditConfig` options are now centralized in this library, not each mod using this library
